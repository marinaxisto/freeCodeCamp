    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk</li>
      <li>1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 cup chocolate sprinkles, for rolling</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a medium saucepan, combine the condensed milk, cocoa powder, and
        butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or
        spatula until the mixture thickens and starts pulling away from the
        bottom and sides of the pan (about 10-15 minutes).
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the mixture onto a greased plate and let it cool to room
        temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once cooled, grease your hands with a little butter, take a small amount
        of the mixture, and roll it into a 1-inch ball.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll the ball in the chocolate sprinkles until it's fully covered, and
        place it in a small paper or foil candy cup. Repeat with the rest of the
        mixture.
      </li>
