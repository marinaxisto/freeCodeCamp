        <h2>Samba</h2>
        <p>
          Samba is a Brazilian musical genre and dance style, with its roots in
          Africa via the West African slave trade and religious traditions. It
          is recognized around the world as a symbol of Brazil and the Brazilian
          Carnival.

        <h2>Bossa Nova</h2>
        <p>
          Bossa Nova, which translates to "new trend" or "new wave," emerged in
          the 1950s and 1960s. It's a lyrical fusion of samba and jazz, known
          for its smooth, melodic style, as famously demonstrated in "The Girl
          from Ipanema."

          popular music in Brazil that revisits typical Brazilian styles. It
